# Infographic Brief: Spectral Crimes of Pangis Cosmology

Title: **Spectral Crimes of Pangis Cosmology**  
Subtitle: *A Forensic Report on the Unified Field Continuity Model*

Goal: Turn the technical critique into a single-page visual “case file” that:

- Shows Pantheon+ residual bumps as the “crime scene”.
- Highlights pathological parameter values (H₀ ≈ 81, Ωₘ ≈ 0.02).
- Frames UFC as a cosmetically patched ΛCDM, not a new unified field theory.

## Layout Summary

(1) Title bar with case ID `Δlog₁₀z ≈ 0.227`.  
(2) Left: residual plot with three circled bumps (Exhibits A, B, C).  
(3) Right: four “crime cards” (Witness Tampering, Evidence Overfitting, Parameter Laundering, Geometric Relapse).  
(4) Bottom: parameter comparison table and verdict stamp: **SPECTRAL MISCONDUCT**.
