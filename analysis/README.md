# Spectral Crimes of Pangis Cosmology

This directory documents a forensic review of Pangis' “Unified Field Continuity” (UFC) cosmology, focused on its claimed log-periodic signal in Pantheon+ SN Ia residuals.

**Contents**

- `pangis_spectral_crimes.md`  
  Full written analysis suitable for inclusion in papers, PDFs, or NotebookLM projects.

- `infographic_brief_spectral_crimes.md`  
  Design brief for the infographic **“Spectral Crimes of Pangis Cosmology”**.

- `pangis_param_comparison.csv`  
  Simple table comparing UFC parameter choices against standard multi-probe cosmology.

- `scripts/`  
  Stub scripts for plotting residual layouts and (optionally) reproducing cosplay log-periodic fits.

- `figs/`  
  Notes and placeholders for figures and infographic exports.

This is not a replication package for UFC; it is a diagnostic kit showing why the model collapses once you stop pampering the parameters.
